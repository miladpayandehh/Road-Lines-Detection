# Road-Lines-Detection
The self-driving cars are one of the latest artificial intelligence technologies in which the computer vision system is used. Self-driving cars use OpenCV's lane detection features to recognize road lanes and are trained not to drive outside the lane. OpenCV library is an open-source and machine learning software.

. Decoding the file frame-by-frame

. Converting the original image to grayscale

. Using filters to reduce noise in video frames

. Detecting edges using the Canny Edge detection method

. Finding the region of interest (ROI) and working on that part

. Detecting lines using the Hough line transformation method
